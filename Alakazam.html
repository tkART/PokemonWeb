			<p>
				Alakazam is characterized by its humanoid structure and large mustache. 
				The female Alakazam has a significantly shorter mustache than the male. 
				Its snout is long and thin, and it has long, ear-like spikes extending 
				from the back of its head. Additional spike protrude from each cheek. 
				Covering its yellow, skeletal body are brown armor-like sections over its 
				chest, shoulders, forearms and knees. There are three toes on each foot, 
				each of which has a white claw. It wields a silver spoon in each hand, 
				which act as amplifiers for its psychic abilities. Alakazam is able to 
				lower the accuracy of its opponents by bending the spoons it wields, using
				 its signature move Kinesis. </br> </br>
				As Mega Alakazam, this Pok&eacutemon gains a large white beard and its mustache 
				becomes larger and white. The armor-like sections become bulkier, and its 
				upper body section becoming slightly shorter to reveal its thin stomach. 
				The head becomes diamond-shaped, but it keeps its four spikes. Additionally, 
				it gains a large, oval, red organ in the center of its forehead. The organ 
				is said to emit psychic power. Its lower legs become longer and slimmer 
				and its feet become skinnier and resemble talons. It gains three additional 
				spoons, which it levitates in the air. Alakazam is able to use all forms 
				of psychic abilities. These powers are used to move its body, as opposed 
				to its weak muscles. It also uses its psychic powers to hold up its head,
				 which is too heavy to be supported by its neck, due to its continually 
				 growing brain. It is said to have an excellent memory and can remember 
				 everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, and has an 
				 IQ that exceeds 5,000. It is found in urban areas.
