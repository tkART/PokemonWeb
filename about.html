					<h1>About Us, the Magical Alakazam Fan Club</h1>
					
						<p>We have are all Nintendo Certified Pokemaster's. All of our most senior group members have caught them all. Of all the Pokemon 
							in the Pokemon Universe, only one can be the best, and in our expert opinion, Alakazam reigns supreme.
						</p>
						<p>Alakazam is super smart, and so are we, which makes us a match made in heaven. Alakazam can attack other Pokemon with his mind.
							We similarly are able to excell with the power of our minds. Point in case, we are all in a Internet Programming course that
							is over a month ahead of schedule. Even the most feeble minds will understand that Alakazam and the Alakazam fan club at nothing 
							to mess with.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							We meet in Poketopia, when the Pokemasters of the Spirit Realm beakons us. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Usually Mondays and Wednesdays on the fifth floor of Pray Harrold.
							</p>
